Earn Up Coding challenge.

Prerequisite Software
* Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* MySql Workbench (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

Get the git repositories
* `git clone https://github.com/stridentbean/earnup-db/`
* `git clone https://github.com/stridentbean/earnup-api`

Database Setup and Importing
* Navigate to the earnup-api
* Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will attempt to start the database and api. The api will fail because the database is not initialized yet 
* Navigate to the earnup db
* Run `npm install`
* Open MySql Workbench and connect to the database
* Execute file `permissions_fix.sql`
* Execute file `create_tables.sql`
* Run `node import.js`. This will take about five minutes to complete. You will have to escape the promopt when it is finished

Running the api
* Navigate to the earnup-api
* Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will attempt to start the database and api. The database is already running and will not be recreated. The api is not running and should now start and connect. 
* Curl away, ex `curl -X POST localhost:3000/v1/properties -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"latitude": 40.7306, "longitude": -73.9352, "distance": 1000, "query": "clean nice grocery"}'`
* Feel free to pipe into JQ for better viewing `| jq .`
